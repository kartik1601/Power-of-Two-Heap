## This is a C++ code for the problem for designing a Novel data structure based upon the heap properties ensuring it covers the following:- 
### 1) The heap must satisfy the heap property. 
### 2) Every parent node in the heap must have 2^x children. 
### 3) The value of x must be a parameter of the heapâ€™s constructor. 
### 4) The heap must implement an insert method. 
### 5) The heap must implement a pop max method.
